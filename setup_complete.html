                Your wifi settings have been saved. The clock will now restart 
                and attempt to connect to your network. In a few moments, you
                should be able to reconnect to your home network and use the 
                address below to access the clock settings in your
                browser.

                If you have problems connecting or need to change wifi settings,
                plug in your clock, hold down the reset button on the bottom 
                for 10 seconds, then unplug and plug it back in.
